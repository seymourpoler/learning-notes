We are living with a lot of distractions, like tv, social network, email, people ... and many more.
We are living in the era of distractions and we can't drop it out, because it is part of our culture.
On the other hand, we are living in the era of information, everything is accessible by a simple click.
Everything around us requires our attention and some of them have to be done as soon as possible. I don't know if we are aware of that. Sometimes it is scaring.
Some kind of activities like dealing with email inbox, could be addictive, like having junk food or a simple drug like cocaine.
It is fun and we have an instant gratification, reward mechanism. When we check the email inbox and we have received a new email from a friend.
All of this technology in our lives is a new lifestyle.
How to drop it out? We have considered as a society that we have to be connected all the time and we have to answer all emails at any time. I think that it could be insane and it doesn't make sense at all.
Definitely it requires courage for doing that.

Concentration is very important these days, because it is required by our daily activities, especially when they require our brain.
One strategy that we could follow is to split them in different processes like reading, writing, dealing with inbox email, etc... along the day. Doing all these activities at once is not a good idea because multitasking hurts our productivity, because our brain needs on average twenty minutes to be fully focused on a new context and every few minutes we are switching the context, it is impossible to get the right thing done well.

Another important point to consider is that the lack of concentration could affect our happiness, because we could feel frustration due to all the things which require our attention and it is impossible to attend them.
It is important to go off from all these distractions, from time to time we need to be quiet and in silent, because we need to recharge our mental batteries, otherwise we could have mental health issues.

We could enjoy our disconnected moments reading a novel, going out for a walk, a great chat with somebody, ... it is grateful.
Disconnection has great benefits like rest, increases our creativity, our concentration, accomplishing more goals and we can connect with people.
How could we be disconnected?
The main idea is setting limits in our daily schedule or flipping to other activities like practicing any sport.

An interesting approach to manage all this stuff is to define a schedule with free distractions, it is focused on minutes to work on projects, minutes for reading all notifications, social media, emails, ... and minutes to rest and to be disconnected. Try to have a balancing schedule.

The more connected a person is, the more distractions they have to face.
We have to be aware of what kind of information we consume and time we spend on it, especially when we are surfing the Internet.
It is crucial to admit the statement that we can consume and read everything

One strategy which we could do to reduce the huge  number of streams of information that we consume is removing all not essential ones.
Another strategy which we could follow to reduce our anxiety is reduce our rush to response all the messages all new messages that we have in our inbox.

Essentially our acts are guided by fear or by love. The key of that is how to reduce our fears, because we are slaves of our fears.
There is a quote that says: "the fear makes the wolf bigger than he is"
One of our fears is not to be updated with the last information, but it is a lie. We should try to it for a while to verify that nothing happens and it should not matter to us.

An antipattern which we have to avoid is not to mix up our todo list with our inbox. By the way a good pattern that we should do is close our inbox email when we are working on something. It is easier than done.

Sometimes, distractions satisfy an emotional need. It is important to be honest with ourself about our real truth about that.

We have desires at some point. We have to examinate if they are good or not for living our lives. It is not simple to drop out some sort of desires.

One step which we should follow to improve our concentration is having a good environment. We could improve our environment little by little, ten or fifteen minutes once or twice two days, creating a perfect environment at once is a bad idea and we could spend a huge number of hours. It is better to improve one area at a time. We could start by cleaning all unnecessary elements from our desk, our walls and our computer for example.

We are living in a constant rush, so multitasking is one approach to follow this stressful lifestyle. But in the end it is not a very productive technique, because our brain needs time to be focused to do some work, but if we are changing among tasks all the time we will do nothing.

By the way, rushing produces more errors than usual, because our brain needs to be quiet to do something well.

Our environment is changing every time because our life is ongoing. We have to accept all those things without getting angry or frustrated, including imperfections, because we cannot control everything in our lives.
We could enjoy our life as a flow of chaos and beauty.

Sometimes achieving a goal is closely related to being happy. But this relation is false. It is better to work on something which comes up instead of having a plan.

Simplify our life means that we have to be focused on our important things. 
We could choose our 4 or 5 the most important things. They could be family time, reading, writing and going to the gym. Little by little we could reduce the amount of time on other not very important things like social media, tv, ...
In our working life is the same idea. We have to select the most exciting and impacting taks and have a clean environment to do those.

It is important to reduce our multitasking because our brains work as one task. Our brain needs more than ten minutes to focus on the current, so if we flip among different tasks, we reduce drastically our concentration and we will make more mistakes rather than doing one single task at once. Our work ends up with a low quality.

From time to time we need some periods of disconnection, because we need to rest and recharge our batteries. It is the perfect time when the fresk ideas come up.
