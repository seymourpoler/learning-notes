# [Pair or not to pair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_eZ-ae2FY8)

pair-programming: two people creating code together in front of a computer. 
An agile practice that it is quite well-known, but partially adopted in the industry

A quote from Jean Bartik, one of the first programmers (1940 - ENIAC's programmers)
"Betty Snyder and I, from the beginning, were a pair. And I beileve that the best programs and designs are done by pairs, because you can criticise each other, and find each other's errors, and user the best ideas."

In the late 90s, this practice is recovered in the book eXtreme Programming by Kent Beck

Some problems that we can found are:
1._ It is a long term benefits, like consistent quality and mantenability. But as developer we want sort term gratification.
The idea is to increase productivity and effectiveness that are very different from only lines of code

2._ It is hard
How pair-programming helps
- 1+1 > 2, it is a easy eay for sharing knownledge
- We can combine to modes of thinking, one is tactical and another is strategical that fit to the two modes: driver and navigator
- Increase the effectiveness about reflection about the number of lines of code that we dont have to write and in the future we will not mantain.
- Focus for the developer on the code and give me more discipline about how to accomplish my tasks. We have to discuss our point of views and our direction with the pair. So we avoid the famous rabbit holes or when someone is stuck on something.
- Focus for the team, introduccing working in progress limit has a huge impact on the team flow and the delivery quality.
- True continous integrations, because the reviewing is on the fly and it is not needed another one after the code is finished, and this thing helps to start with trunk based development, really frecuent integration, and the feeling more confident to pushing things into trunk branch. Some the code-review process can be a bottle neck and it is something really hassle.
There is a correlation between high performance team and short integration cycles.

3._Sometimes could be more harmfull than helpfull:
- It cosumes a lot of energy, so an advice: dont pair 8 hour a day, it is too much. Taking breaks, to go to the toilet, drink water, use a time manager technique like pomodoro, switch roles and modes along the day. It is good trying to find the balance
- It is a really intense mode of collaboration, it is a great way to give and receive feedback
- Be awareness that we are very diffent people

4._ It is something personal
- We share our space, our computer, our desktop, ... Because we share all the things that we dont know as well and pair programming shows our vulnerabilities. And it is hard. So we have to find a safety environment and phycological safety

So we have to put in practice: concentration, task organisation, time management, comunication, giving and receiving feedback and empathy

A conference in London the speaker Pia Nilson, from Spotify, she spokes about how to optimize the flow for work and he said that with tdd and pairing the friction and conflicts were reducced. Another item for getting high performance team is diversity, although at the beggin encrease friction between people.
Diversity in a team increase the challenge of pair programming.
A quote from the maganize Hardvard Business Review: "So homogeneous teams feel easier but easy is bad for performance."

It is fun, increase the relations in the members of the team. So improve the active listening, friendly feedback, humility, positive retros, find purpose for the team, reduce the conflicts in the team.

Sometimes pair-programming is avoided due to these kind of conflicts, but we have to prepare our skills to avoid them and increase our collaboration to become a high perfomamce team.
