# [Deliveritis Aguda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGCowJY5QCQ)
The main idea is how to maximize my rate of delivering, because it is about money
1._ A story is done when it is production.
2._ Strategy of managing source code: Trunk Based Developtment with feature toggle.
3._ A developer can deloy to production.
4._ User stories as small as possible with value for business optimizing pareto principle.
5._ Deploy to production as easy as possible, and rollback. If it is possible with one click.
6._ QA as a bottleneck, the team is resposible of the quality of the features. So every developer has to test features as a multidisciplinary team.
7._ Deliveried stories by prioritation
8._ Retros about improve the delivery, minize the time, increase the rate and with more quality.
