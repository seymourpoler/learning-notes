Fluency equation

My motivation and my whys. 

My real motivation, why I want to learn English.

Setting up a real goal. Setting up a deadline for reaching this goal. In other words, which level I want to have and in which amount of time.

It is basic to get my goals, create a routine, what I have to do on my daily basis.

Other interesting question is, which kind of English do I want to know?, because there are several types of English. English for Business is not the same as English for tourists.

I learned that C1 English level, is when I feel comfortable speaking the language, I can understand almost everything, but not at a native speaker level.

Other important question is how much time do I invest in learning English?

I have to become an independent learner. I have to  take the responsibility or the control of your learnings. I am not used to doing that, because in a typical situation, there is a huge number of academies out there which teach English “without effort”. It seems that the responsibility of teaching/learning is the academy, not mine. The truth is that the responsibility for learning English or whatever, is only mine.

One of the strategies about learning English is to create my own bubble of English with lots of inputs. The author of the video calls It immersion. The cons of this method is that it takes a huge number of hours and the learner has to consume a lot of English content to reach their goal.

Other strategy is learning English through sentences, because context matters. It is like learning  vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation all together at once. If I repeat them, I will learn how to put different parts of my mouth (tongue, lips and teeth) in the right way. Very interesting approach of that is, by imitation. Recording a sentence and comparing the difference. I think that it is a very good way of improving and learning as well.

An important aspect which we have to consider is to make this process of learning English really fun, because it is a journey which lasts too much time. In this particular case, consistency is very important.

Most of the learning is subconscious, it is the way that the brain works. For me this tip blows my mind up, because most of my learnings have been doing through effort and in a conscious way.

The other side of the very successful English learning method is time. If I have the best method, but I don't have time, I won't learn anything. By the way it is important to include a part of my routine at least 10 minutes every single day, on my daily basis.
